The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, causing unexpected layout issues.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox item without specifying `width` may lead to the element not shrinking as expected.  Another common mistake is incorrect operator precedence within `calc()` expressions. For instance, `calc(20% + 50px * 2)` would produce a different result than `calc((20% + 50px) * 2)`.
